    <p>
      Pempek is one of the most popular dishes from the city of Palembang in
      South Sumatra.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pempek can be eaten for breakfast, lunch and dinner in Palembang. It
      consists of fish, flour and water and can be cooked, fried or baked.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>600 gr</b> Spanish mackerel / king mackerel</li>
      <li><b>280 gr</b> tapioca flour</li>
      <li><b>5 cloves</b> garlic</li>
      <li><b>1 tbs</b> salt</li>
      <li><b>100 ml</b> cold water</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Recipe instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Grind the mackerel with the cold water, garlic and salt</li>
      <li>To begin the kneading process</li>
      <li>
        Once the texture becomes soft and smooth, put it in a bowl or flat
        surface and add the tapioca flour then mix it until fully incorp
        incorporated. There's no need to knead the dough, otherwise I'll becomes
        hard when it's cooked
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, boil some water in a pot with a little bit of oil. Then we
        start molding the pempek
      </li>
      <li>
        Add some tapioca flour on your hand when you mold the pempek, and make a
        long cylinder shape for 70gr each and round shape for 100gr each
      </li>
      <li>
        For the cylinder ones or we call it "pempek lenjer", you can immediately
        put into boiling water. Let it boil until it's floating
      </li>
      <li>
        For the round ones, we will add an egg inside to make "pempek kapal
        selam"
      </li>
      <li>
        Making "pempek kapal selam": make a hole with your thumb on top, press
        it open to create a Crater shape, big enough to put an egg yolk inside
      </li>
      <li>
        Add an egg yolk with a little bit of egg white, then close the crater by
        bringing the corner of the crater together until it's fully closed, to
        avoid the egg from leaking
      </li>
      <li>
        Then drop it into the boiling water, let it boiled until it's floating
        then add about 20mins more. This additional time requires to ensure the
        egg on the inside is also well cooked
      </li>
      <li>
        This recipe should make 4 kapal selam and 8 lenjer. It's up to you how
        you want to shape them, if you think making lenjer is easier, you can
        also shape them all as lenjer (long cylinder)
      </li>
      <li>
        Once everything is boiled, keep it aside until it's cool down before we
        fry it
      </li>
    </ol>
